							<h2 style="color:tomato"><u> Career Objectives </u></h2>
							<p> Hello! üòÉ <br />
								My name is Pheng Ang Chiv or Andy if you prefer, born and raised in Cambodia üá∞üá≠. 
								I started off my college journey at Cypress College in Orange County, California and then 
						        transfered to California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo where I earned both a bachelor's degree of Applied Mathematics with Statistics Minor 
								and a master's degree in Business Analytics Program. 
								<br/> 
								<br/>
								
								My first hands-on project with Natural Language Processing techniques sparked my curiosity in the real-world applications of data science. 
								This interest led me to pursue a Master's Degree in Business Analytics 
								where I can strengthen my knowledge in Machine Learning, Statistics and Programming skills. 
								I am passionate about working with large datasets to draw insights for business problems. 
								I have proficiency in Python and R Programming languages, Data Management with SQL, and Data Visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn and Tableau. 
								As a field where constant learning is needed, I have completed Data Science and Kaggle projects by building machine learning models including 
								Regression, Random Forest, K-NN and Niave Bayes Classification, and Principle Component Analysis. </p>

							<h2 style="color:tomato"><u> Personal Interests</u></h2>
							<p> I have called myself a <b>photographer</b> for a while now, and I love doing portrait and event photography. 
								As much as I do not want to believe Myers-Briggs Personality Test, it does not surprise me that I am <b> ‚ÄúConsul‚Äù </b> 
								because I love building communities and connecting to people wherever my life takes me. It brings me joy 
								when I can interact with people and give them a glimpse of happiness through my photography skill. 
								Aside from that, I am a big fan of road-tripping (I‚Äôve completed 4 road trips across the US), cooking 
								and giving back to the community (a 3-year experienced International Welcome Ambassador at Cal Poly). </p>
							<ul>
								<li> Myers-Briggs Personality:  <b> ESFJ-A (Consul) </b> </li>
								<li> Favorite Place: <b> Yosemite National Park, California </b> </li>
								<li> Favorite Food: <b> Obsessed with Pad Thai </b> </li>
							</ul>
							
							<p> </p>
							<h2 style="color:tomato"><u>Leadership and Volunteer Experience </u></h2>
							<p> Outside of academia, I love immersing myself in diverse communities to learn about different cultures and recognize people's differences.  
								As someone who loves building a community and traveling, I thrive in a cultural environment and always find myself partaking in a variety of organizations 
						        wherever I am at. I consider myself a servant leader who takes pride in making positive changes in people's lives.</p>
